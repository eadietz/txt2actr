A new cognitive model will be constructed: /Users/thd7as/Documents/GitHub/txt2actr/benchmarks/use-cases/flight-task/cognitive-model-specification/model.lisp will be the cognitive model
A connection to ACT-R will be established now... waiting for 15 seconds until ACT-R is ready ...
ACT-R connection has been started.
